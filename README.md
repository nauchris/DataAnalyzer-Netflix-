# 📺 Data Analyzer, but for Netflix doeeeee 🎬  

## **🎤 Storytime: How This Project Was Born**  

So there I was, deep in **Python scripts, data analysis, and debugging errors** at 2 AM when suddenly—💡an idea hit me.  

I had just applied for a job at **Netflix**, and I thought, *"Why not impress them by analyzing their own content?"* Genius, right?  

Originally, this was supposed to be a **generic** data analysis project, but nope! I took a detour, made a U-turn, and **Netflixified™** it. Now, it's all about:  

- 🍿 Finding out which **genres dominate Netflix**  
- 🎥 Figuring out the **top-rated movies**  
- ⏳ Tracking how Netflix's content library has **grown over the years**  
- 📊 Creating **eye-popping visualizations** so we can pretend we're in a data science movie montage

## **🔧 What This Project Does**
This **Python script** loads a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows, cleans it up, analyzes trends, and produces fancy charts like:  

✅ **Genre popularity** (Drama? Comedy? Crime? Probably all three.)  
✅ **Top 10 highest-rated movies** (Because we only want the good stuff!)  
✅ **How many shows/movies Netflix adds each year** (Spoiler: A lot.)  

And most importantly, it does all of this while **making me look employable**.
